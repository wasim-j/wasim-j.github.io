# Character Set
To display the HTML page correctly, a browser must know what character set (encoding) is being used

- ASCII was the first character encoding standard and had 128 characters
- ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set, it used 256 characters
- ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML4, also supported 256 characters
- UTF-8 covers almost all the characters and symbols in the world and **is the default character encoding for HTML5**
