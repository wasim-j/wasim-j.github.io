# Entities
- Some characters are reserved in HTML. For example, if you use < or > in your text the browser might mix them up with tags
- To avoid this character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML
- format for a character entity is 
		&entity_name OR &#entity_number
- Symbol entities also exist for mathematical, technical and currency symbols that are not usually present on a keyboard

## Example
To show: `<div></div>` on a web page use `&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;`  to produce &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
- `&lt;` stands in for `<` (less than)
- `&gt;` stands in for `>` (greater than)
