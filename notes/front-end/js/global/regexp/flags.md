# Flags

## g - global match 
find all matches rather than stopping after the first match

## i - ignore case 
if u flag is also enabled, use Unicode case folding

## m - multiline
treat beginning and end characters (^ and $) as working over multiple lines (i.e., match the beginning or end of each line (delimited by \n or \r), not only the very beginning or end of the whole input string)

## u- Unicode
treat pattern as a sequence of Unicode code points

## y- sticky
matches only from the index indicated by the lastIndex property of this regular expression in the target string (and does not attempt to match from any later indexes).
