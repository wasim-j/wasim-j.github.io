# Date Methods

## Date.now()
Returns the numeric value corresponding to the current time - the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC, with leap seconds ignored.

## Date.parse()
Parses a string representation of a date and returns the number of milliseconds since 1 January, 1970, 00:00:00, UTC, with leap seconds ignored.
Note: Parsing of strings with Date.parse is strongly discouraged due to browser differences and inconsistencies.

## Date.UTC()
Accepts the same parameters as the longest form of the constructor (i.e. 2 to 7) and returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC, with leap seconds ignored.
