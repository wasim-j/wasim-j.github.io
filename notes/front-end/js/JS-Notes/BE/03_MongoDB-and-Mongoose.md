MongoDB is a database that stores data records (documents) for use by an application. Mongo is a non-relational, "NoSQL" database. This means Mongo stores all data associated within one record, instead of storing it across many preset tables as in a SQL database. Some benefits of this storage model are:

* Scalability: by default, non-relational databases are split (or "sharded") across many systems instead of only one. This makes it easier to improve performance at a lower cost.
* Flexibility: new datasets and properties can be added to a document without the need to make a new table for that data.
* Replication: copies of the database run in parallel so if one goes down, one of the copies becomes the new primary data source.


While there are many non-relational databases, Mongo's use of JSON as its document storage structure makes it a logical choice when learning backend JavaScript. Accessing documents and their properties is like accessing objects in JavaScript.

Mongoose.js is an npm module for Node.js that allows you to write objects for Mongo as you would in JavaScript. This can make is easier to construct documents for storage in Mongo.
