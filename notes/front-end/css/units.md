# Understand Absolute versus Relative Units
Pixels are a type of length unit, which is what tells the browser how to size or space an item. In addition to `px`, CSS has a number of different length unit options that you can use.

The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. 

## Absolute 
Absolute units tie to physical units of length.  

For example, `in` and `mm` refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution.

## Relative 
Relative units, such as `em` or `rem`, are relative to another length value.  

For example, `em` is based on the size of an element's font. If you use it to set the font-size property itself, it's relative to the parent's font-size.
