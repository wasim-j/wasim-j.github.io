# Color Theory
On a website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. Using different combinations of colors can really change the look of a website, and a lot of thought can go into picking a color palette that works with your content.

## Color Wheel
The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart.  

When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called **complementary colors**.  
They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they "cancel" each other out and create a gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast.

Some examples of complementary colors with their hex codes are:
- <span style="background-color:#FF0000">red (#FF0000)</span> and <span style="background-color:#00FFFF">cyan (#00FFFF)</span>
- <span style="background-color:#00FF00">green (#00FF00)</span> and <span style="background-color:#FF00FF">magenta (#FF00FF)</span>
- <span style="background-color:#0000FF">blue (#0000FF)</span> and <span style="background-color:#FFFF00">yellow (#FFFF00)</span>

There are many color picking tools available online that have an option to find the complement of a color.

### Overuse
Complimentary colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more vibrant when placed side-by-side.  

However, the strong visual contrast can be jarring if it's overused on a website, and can sometimes make text harder to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. In practice, one of the colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain content on the page.

## RGB
Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light. This is known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory.  

### Primary Colors
Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are called primary colors.  
**Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors** cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and yellow (R + G).  

### Secondary Colors
These **secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation**, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. 

For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.

### Tertiary Colors
Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange. This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.

### split-complementary color scheme
This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.

Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:
Color	Hex Code
orange	#FF7D00
cyan	#00FFFF
raspberry	#FF007D
